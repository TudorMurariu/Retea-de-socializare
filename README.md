## Project with GUI

&nbsp; **As part of a full-semester faculty project, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of Java while expanding my skillset. Throughout the project, I gained experience in domain-driven design, lambdas, JavaFX UI development, database connectivity, file handling in Java, and the observer pattern. The experience was an excellent opportunity to build on my existing Java expertise while exploring new areas of the language**
